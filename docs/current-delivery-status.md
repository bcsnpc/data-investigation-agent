# Current delivery status

Updated 2026-09-14. **PR #166 is merged.** The next grouped milestone adds [reviewed watermark freshness evidence](watermark-freshness-milestone.md), tracked by [#167](https://github.com/bcsnpc/data-investigation-agent/issues/167), implemented in [PR #168](https://github.com/bcsnpc/data-investigation-agent/pull/168).

## What is built

| Area | Delivered | Current boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Business foundation | Related 100000-order dataset, Azure SQL loading and orders application | Existing deployment; no new application deployment in this milestone |
| Analytics | Fabric Bronze/Silver/Gold processing, reconciliation, semantic model and Power BI reports | Complete native/source snapshot certification remains separate |
| Bounded-v1 investigator | Two-metric diagnosis, LLM-assisted ticket planning, review/evidence/routing workflows, defect labs and demos | Preserved as the bounded baseline |
| V2 onboarding/catalog | Admin UI/API, model registration, metadata scans, immutable contexts, business review, dependency discovery and invalidation | Hosted onboarding and broader semantic/context coverage remain |
| V2 diagnostic tools | Metadata-selected Power BI scalar/dependency/dimension reads, SQL count/sum reads, typed filters, saved receipts and comparison gaps | Scope/version/equivalence proof remains incomplete |
| Durable runtime | Typed plans, reserved budgets/receipts, idempotency, worker fencing, explicit recovery and timeout holds | Local operator runtime; uncertain completion is not automatically retried |
| Adaptive diagnostic loop | LLM selects the next admitted test from saved observations; hypotheses, clarification, scope successors and stop reasons persist | Not a complete causal verifier; source tests still need reviewed configuration |
| Governed adaptive controls | Shared daily reservations, policy pinning, cancellation/reconciliation and no-progress stopping | Same catalog/environment; provider-wide spend is not certified |
| Scoped freshness evidence | Metadata-selected watermark reads, immutable reviewed policies, revocation and deterministic age conditions | Narrow historical watermark rule only; no production SLA or report-cause proof |
| Shared projections | Business and technical API projections share one session, scope and outcome hash | Backend only; unified v2 ticket UI is not deployed |

**Validation:** 548 script tests passed, including 20 focused freshness tests. The new live SQL diagnostic read 100000 non-null timestamps on its first connection attempt and correctly retained the missing-policy gap. Durable replay made no cloud call. Earlier governance validation also exercised two LLM decisions/two data reads, daily reservations and cancellation. No new UI deployment or production freshness SLA is claimed.

## Where we are

**Phase A is verified. B-E have working implementation slices. F/G now have durable execution, evidence-led planning and governed session controls; their full acceptance gates remain open.** H is pending. I has a shared backend projection but still needs its user workflow; J has reusable bounded-v1 routing but no completed v2 handoff.

The new path can select a catalog measure, choose and run an approved diagnostic, observe the result and choose a different next test. It no longer requires an operator to prewrite the whole sequence. It still cannot certify a general business cause from incomplete evidence. Numeric observations and diagnostic differences come from saved receipts. A reviewed watermark policy can now establish a narrow age condition; the reported business cause, hypotheses and routing remain unverified.

## Remaining grouped milestones

1. **Complete trustworthy investigation and proof:** effective report/identity/date context, authoritative source mappings, version/shared-generation evidence, supported causal/freshness/application-intent verifiers, impact/ownership and provider-wide monetary governance. Shared adaptive request allowances are now implemented. Complete the remaining B-G exit gates together with meaningful end-to-end checks.
2. **Prove generality:** freeze the runtime and run all eight hidden/native acceptance families, including new additive, ratio and complex measures, healthy/defect/gap variants and repeated planner evaluations. Current injected tests and live smoke checks do not replace this gate.
3. **Complete the user product:** resolve business tickets/screenshots into reviewed scope, build the shared business/technical workspace, integrate reviewed v2 routing/triage, then deploy and verify the complete workflow.
