# Owner actions and deferred options

## Current authority record

The prior Key Vault data-plane refusal is resolved as an authority decision:
the owner explicitly approved Key Vault Secrets Officer on the one installation
vault on 2026-10-12. The operator applied it at 02:41:15 UTC; the subsequent
secret-metadata listing passed and returned `[]`. This does not prove worker
secret retrieval or authorize any other vault. The detailed execution receipts
and scope record remain in the round's owner-controlled delivery record.

The owner also approved moving the existing read-only user's delegated cache to
that vault for this cross-tenant test. It remains the same user and existing
scope. The platform managed identity fetches the secret; the user performs the
estate read. Definition-only Contributor credentials must not serve quantities.
There is no automatic CLI/operator fallback. Platform managed-identity health subsequently passed for PostgreSQL, Blob and
Key Vault; the existing delegated reader authenticated separately for its Power
BI and SQL audiences. These are platform/authentication facts, not estate route
readiness. No further owner approval is requested at this checkpoint. The
application SQL workstation credential has not been made a cloud route and stays
explicitly unreachable; any future migration or new scope needs its own recorded
authority decision. Current bounded cloud verification and demo remain operator
work, not an unexplained owner action.

## Future option only: secretless cross-tenant estate access

No app registration, federation or permission change is performed by this guide.
For a future client installation, deploy in the Fabric tenant and use direct
managed identity where the particular API supports it and access is approved.

A possible cross-tenant alternative is a multitenant Entra application, a service
principal provisioned/consented in the resource tenant, and an application
federated identity credential trusting the worker's user-assigned managed
identity. The application and managed identity belong to the same home tenant;
the trust identifies the MI principal, tenant issuer and token-exchange audience.
This removes a stored app secret but does not grant target-resource access or
override Fabric API limitations. It needs a separately reviewed application,
consent and scope decision before implementation. See the
[Microsoft Learn configuration requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/workload-id/workload-identity-federation-config-app-trust-managed-identity)
and the [general-availability announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/identity/access-cloud-resources-across-tenants-without-secrets-ga/).


## Round Eighteen close (2026-10-13)

No new owner permission is requested to explain the unfinished demo. Both fresh cloud verifications passed their reader probes but failed exact replay; no demo was admitted. The request-normalization fix is implemented offline, but a subsequent operator session must prepare new engine/context pins, earn exact verification, and then attempt the demo. Old witnesses cannot be transferred. Full claim-first/case-file shared persistence, complete client preflight, archive conversion and retention enforcement are engineering work, not missing human approval. Source-application cloud authentication and cross-tenant federation remain separately governed future decisions.
